## Sylvana Rose Art hand-drawn website

Hi there!

As I have a pronounced artistic side, I dreamed of a hand-drawn website to share links.

I took my time to deploy it but you can finally enter my world [here](https://sylvanarose.art/).

To do this, I used "png" and "gif" as images/animated images, JavaScript and CSS to interact and animate.

Tip: Click or tap corals to animate and grab bubbles to visit external links.

PS: On laptop, you can play with a cutie octopus, who is called *"Poulpi"*.

**Enjoy!**
